### Project Description

MovieHub is a full-stack web application that was built with the idea to provide its users with a way to quickly and easily find movies and create their personal watchlists. This app is powered by currently one of the most popular frameworks - Vue.js. MovieHub employs various features, which includes: a system in place to search for movies by term and date, an ability to create personal favorites lists and watchlists, watched movie tracking, and fully functional authentication structure. Most of the applications' UI has unit and integration tests in place and was implemented using Jest and Vue-Test-Utils libraries. Last, but not least, MovieHub employs a user-friendly, modern and most importantly - modern, design, which was achieved with the help of Bootstrap and SASS libraries. TMDb (The Movie Database) API is used to fetch movies.
